# Solar-Radiation-Blackbody-Curves
In this python exercise, using Wien's displacement law &amp; Planck's blackbody law, the solar radiation is studied.

solar radiation.py : In this python file, by using the Wien's displacement law and Planck's blackbody law, the spectral intensity distribution of the Sun was plotted. Also, you can input the radius & temperature of a star you want to use, then you can compare the luminosity of this star with the Sun.

blackbody curve.py : With this python file, the spectral intensity distribution of different temperatures can be studied and plotted.
